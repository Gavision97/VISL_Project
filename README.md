# VISL - Weather Prediction Model by Pollutants

## ðŸ“¦ Environment Setup

To ensure all dependencies are properly installed, we use a Conda environment.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Install Conda**

   If you haven't already, download and install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) for your OS.

2. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/visl.git
   cd visl
   ```

3. **Create the Environment**

   Use the `environment.yml` file provided in the project root to create a Conda environment named `visl`.

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

4. **Activate the Environment**

   ```bash
   conda activate visl
   ```

5. **Run the Project**

   Now you're ready to run your scripts and notebooks using the `visl` environment.
